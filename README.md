# HTML-MDN
The MDN documentatio divides learning HTML into 3 Modules namely :

**1.Introduction to HTML**

**2.Multimedia and Embedding**

**3.HTML Tables**

As I study further, I will be updating the readme with notes about what I am learning in each section.

It will serve me as a guide to revise HTML whenever I need in future.
